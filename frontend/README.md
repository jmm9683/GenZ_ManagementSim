# GenZ_ManagementSim Frontend

This is our master branch.

The required installations to get the frontend running on your local machine:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

After installing Node.js you will have the npm package manager. Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run the command:

	npm i

Then to start the frontend, run the command:

	npm start

The frontend will now be running on http://localhost:4200/. Make sure to run the backend and simulators as well.
