This is our master branch.

The required installations to get the frontend running on your local machine:

	Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing Node.js you will have the npm package manager. Navigate to this directory in your terminal and run the command:

	npm i

Then run the command:

	npm start

To start the frontend on port 4200 and go to http://localhost:4200/ to view the running code. Make sure to run the backend and simulators as well.
